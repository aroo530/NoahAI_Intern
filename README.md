<h3>This is the end, I guess this project was both exhausting and fun. I cannot thank you enough for your help. I wish I attended more meetings they were informative, but oh well, regret won't do much would it? I cannot thank you enough because this project has set my foot on a new journey. I wish I would spend more time with you though, but I guess it came to an end, but who knows, I may apply for a job there and we become colleagues XD</h3>
